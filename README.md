   - Facebook Marketing as the lowest performer in Conversion Rate and ROI.
   - Specific campaign IDs, target audiences (e.g., Men 18-24 with highest CTR), and customer segments (e.g., Foodies with highest CTR) driving engagement.
   - Variations in Cost Per Click (CPC) across channels, with Google Ads being the highest.
   - Geographical performance differences, with Los Angeles having the highest CTR.

4. Impact: Advised tailoring future campaigns to the unique needs and preferences of these high-performing segments, particularly focusing on personalized      email strategies for Men 18-24 and targeted content for Foodies, to drive increased conversion rates and engagement.

### Geographical and Spend Analysis

1. Objective: To understand regional campaign effectiveness and the relationship between marketing spend and outcomes.
2. Action: Analyzed CTR by location (Los Angeles, Miami) and investigated monthly spend trends, correlating spending with conversion rates and ROI.
3. Result: Found Los Angeles exhibited the highest CTR (10.000601). Observed a fluctuating spend trend, with February 2021 showing the lowest spend but         August 2021 having the highest, and January 2021 leading in ROI. It was noted that higher spending generally correlated with higher Conversion Rate and      ROI.
4. Impact: Suggested deeper analysis into the reasons for low spend in specific months (e.g., February) and recommended leveraging customer feedback and        insights to refine targeting efforts, ensuring more effective regional campaigns and optimizing spend for maximum return.
